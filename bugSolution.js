The solution is to avoid using the `@apply` directive within dynamically rendered components. Instead, apply the necessary Tailwind classes directly to the component's elements. This ensures the classes are applied during runtime, resolving the styling issues. Below is an example of how to modify the code to resolve this:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// ... (Component code) ...
<div class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  // ... (Component content) ...
</div>
// ... (Rest of the component code) ...
```
By directly applying the classes, we bypass the `@apply` directive, thereby ensuring that the styles are applied correctly, regardless of whether the component is dynamically rendered.

This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Vue or React. The issue stems from how Tailwind's `@apply` directive interacts with the framework's component system. If you are using `@apply` within a component that is dynamically rendered or conditionally applied, it might not work as expected. This is due to Tailwind's postcss-based nature, where it processes styles at build time, while dynamic components in frameworks are usually handled at runtime. As a result, Tailwind might not inject the appropriate CSS classes, thus leading to unexpected styling issues.

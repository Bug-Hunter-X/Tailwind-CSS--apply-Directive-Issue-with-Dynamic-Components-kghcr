# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Issue with Dynamic Components

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive within dynamically rendered components in JavaScript frameworks like Vue or React. The problem arises from the discrepancy between Tailwind's build-time CSS processing and the framework's runtime component rendering.

## Problem
The `@apply` directive, while convenient, might not work as expected if the component using it is rendered conditionally or dynamically. Tailwind processes styles during the build process, so any styles applied within dynamically generated components may not be picked up, leading to styling issues.

## Solution
The solution often involves moving away from using `@apply` in favor of directly applying classes to the component. This ensures that the classes are applied correctly regardless of when the component is rendered.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the project using `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the dynamically rendered component and note the styling issues.
5. Compare this behavior with the solution provided in `bugSolution.js`.
